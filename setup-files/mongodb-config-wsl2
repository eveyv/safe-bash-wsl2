#ensure you are in root folder of your subsystem (navigate backwards two directories from ~) and then create the path that mongodb requires for its data dump:
sudo mkdir -p data/db

#once the path has been created, permissions must be given for access:
sudo chown -R `id -un` data/db

#run the command to confirm the local db fires up!:
mongod
